                    <li>1 tbps white sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>3 tbps butter, melted</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 mins. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                </ol>
